<!-- Paragraphs containing Lyrics -->
<p>
    You're looking kinda lonely girl
    Would you like someone new to talk to 
    Ah-yeah, alright 
    I'm feeling kinda lonely too If you don't mind, 
    can I sit down here beside you 
    Ah-yeah, alright 
    If I seem to come on too strong 
    I hope that you will understand </p>

<p>
    I say these things 'cause I'd like to know
    If you're as lonely as I am and if you mind
    Sharing the night together, oh, yeah
        Sharing the night together, oh, yeah
        Sharing the night.
</p>
<p>We could bring in the morning, girl
    If you want to go that far
    And if tomorrow find us together
    Right here the way we are, would you mind
    Sharing the night together, oh, yeah
    Sharing the night together, oh, yeah
    Sharing the night</p>
<p>
    Would you like to dance with me and hold me
    You know I want to be holding you
    Ah-yeah, alright
    'Cause I like feeling like I do
    And I see in your eyes that you're liking it, I'm liking it too
    Ah yeah, alright Like to get to know you better
        Is there a place where we can go
        Where we can be alone together
        And turn the lights down low
        And start sharing the night together, oh, yeah
        Sharing the night together, oh, yeah
        Sharing the night together Sharing the night together
        Sharing the night together
        Sharing the night together
        Sharing the night together</p>
